## Description
UrbTown strives to consolidate information from numerous on-line resources into one place so that it's easy for someone to find the information that they need about a new place.

UrbTown currently gets its information from Google Places and YellowPages to provide location details and reviews. As development progresses, UrbTown will support other 3rd party services that provide information useful for the intent of UrbTown.
